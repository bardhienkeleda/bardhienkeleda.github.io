Enkeleda Bardhi is a PostDoc with [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/) at the [Networked Systems Group]("https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/software-technology/networked-systems"), working with [Prof. Fernando Kuipers]("https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=W9BWce4AAAAJ&hl=it&oi=ao") on network programmability and security as part of [Future Network Services (FNS) project]("https://futurenetworkservices.nl"). 
Previously she was a short-term PostDoc at DIAG, Sapienza University of Rome, working with [Prof. Silvia Bonomi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=list_works&hl=it&hl=it&user=s-szb04AAAAJ&sortby=pubdate) and [Prof. Riccardo Lazzeretti](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mBq2JNsAAAAJ&hl=it&oi=ao), while being a collaborator of [SPRITZ Research Group](https://spritz.math.unipd.it/) at University of Padua, lead by [Prof. Mauro Conti]("https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0BcsOY8AAAAJ&hl=it&oi=ao"). She obtained the Ph.D. degree in Computer Science Engineering on May 2024, from Sapienza University of Rome. During her Ph.D., from August to November 2023, she was with [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/) at the [PurNet group](https://gitlab.com/purnet-lab/purnet-lab.gitlab.io/-/wikis/home) hosted by [Prof. Muhammad Shahbaz](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=it&user=UhWjpNMAAAAJ). Additionally, from October 2022 to February 2023, she was with Delft University of Technology at the Networked and Embedded Systems Group hosted by Prof. Fernando Kuipers.
Her research interests include applications of Machine Learning and neuro-symbolic AI for network security and intelligent networked systems. Regarding networking paradigms, she has worked with programmable networks and Named-Data Networking. ML applications for networking include traffic classification and network intrusion detection systems, while neuro-symbolic AI aims to make ML-based decision-making in the networks interpretable and more efficient. Her papers are published on well-known venues, including USENIX OSDI, IEEE Euro S&P, Elsevier FGCS, IEEE COMST, IEEE Network, IEEE LCN and ACM ARES.

I am always open to collaborations and supervising motivated students. If interested, drop me an [e-mail](mailto:E.Bardhi-1@tudelft.nl).
