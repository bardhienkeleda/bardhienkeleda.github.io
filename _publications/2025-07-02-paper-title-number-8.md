title: "O'MINE: A Novel Collaborative DDoS Detection Mechanism for Programmable Data-Planes"
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/2024-02-17-paper-title-number-8
excerpt: 'This paper presents OMINE, a system that leverges lightweight in-network ML models that collaboratively contribute on a per-packet decision for DDoS attack detection. We tackle mainly two challenges: (a) lowering the FPR for DDoS detection and (b) feature collection feasibility for in-network solutions.'
